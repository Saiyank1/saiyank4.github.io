	   <div class="About">
		   <p>An aircraft pilot or aviator is a person who controls the flight of an aircraft<br> by operating its directional flight controls. Some other aircrew members, <br>such as navigators or flight engineers, are also considered aviators, <br>because they are involved in <br>operating the aircraft's navigation and engine systems.<br><br> Other aircrew members, such as <br>drone operators, flight attendants, mechanics and ground crew, are not classified as aviators. <br>To know the process click in the buttom below</p><br>
